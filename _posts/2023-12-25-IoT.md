## Internet of Things <br>

### IoT Seminar <br>

I was unable to attend the IoT seminar, but I was able to ask one of my friends who took the course about the events that took place. I also used some of the ideas and pictures from that day to use here. In the seminar, there was an experiment about a simple traffic light made with jumper cables/wires, LEDs (red, yellow, green), a breadboard, USB cable resistors, and an Arduino Uno.

Another experiment was a button that would turn some LEDs on if pressed, we used, ARDUINO UNO, LED, BREADBOARD, BUTTON, USB CABLE

We will talk about coding in Arduino, to make the Chipset actually interact with the rest of our design we should create a code for it, this programming language is based on C++ and has two function, one at startup and another one that loops over and over, arduino boards come with their own IDE made by Arduino
Arduino itself is one of the many best chipboards you can use for any IOT application, alongside it is a more heavier duty Raspberry Pi (personal favorite btw!)<br>

This seminar as a great way for someone who has no prior experience with IOT to get started with mini computers and IOT, however we didn't get into too much detail about any of the topics from what i heard and that is understadable, IOT is a very very vast field, you could have years worth of knowledge and still learn something new the next day about it


### Best Elevator <br>
<strong>Using IoT to solve or reduce problems</strong><br>
Here are some ways IoT can help mitigate the issues<br>

Smart Home Automation:<br>
Problem: Energy wastage, security concerns.<br>
Solution: Smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security cameras that can be controlled remotely. These devices can optimize energy usage and enhance home security.<br>

Healthcare Monitoring:<br>
Problem: Remote patient monitoring, chronic disease management.<br>
Solution: Wearable devices and health sensors connected to the IoT can monitor vital signs, track health metrics, and provide real-time data to healthcare providers for better patient care.<br>

Smart Agriculture:<br>
Problem: Efficient resource usage in agriculture, crop monitoring.<br>
Solution: IoT-enabled sensors in the field can monitor soil moisture, temperature, and crop health. Automated irrigation systems can optimize water usage, leading to improved crop yield.<br>

Industrial IoT (IIoT):<br>
Problem: Equipment downtime, inefficiencies in manufacturing.<br>
Solution: IoT sensors on machinery can provide real-time data on equipment performance. Predictive maintenance algorithms can help prevent breakdowns, reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.<br>

Smart Cities:<br>
Problem: Traffic congestion, waste management.<br>
Solution: IoT-connected traffic lights and sensors can optimize traffic flow. Smart waste bins equipped with sensors can alert authorities when they need to be emptied, improving waste management.
