## Internet of Things <br>

### IoT Seminar <br>

I was unable to attend the IoT seminar, but I was able to ask one of my friends who took the course about the events that took place. I also used some of the ideas and pictures from that day to use here. In the seminar, there was an experiment about a simple traffic light made with jumper cables/wires, LEDs (red, yellow, green), a breadboard, USB cable resistors, and an Arduino Uno.

Another experiment was a button that would turn some LEDs on if pressed, we used, ARDUINO UNO, LED, BREADBOARD, BUTTON, USB CABLE

We will talk about coding in Arduino, to make the Chipset actually interact with the rest of our design we should create a code for it, this programming language is based on C++ and has two function, one at startup and another one that loops over and over, arduino boards come with their own IDE made by Arduino
Arduino itself is one of the many best chipboards you can use for any IOT application, alongside it is a more heavier duty Raspberry Pi (personal favorite btw!)<br>

This seminar as a great way for someone who has no prior experience with IOT to get started with mini computers and IOT, however we didn't get into too much detail about any of the topics from what i heard and that is understadable, IOT is a very very vast field, you could have years worth of knowledge and still learn something new the next day about it


### Best Elevator <br>
<strong>Using IoT to solve or reduce problems</strong><br>
Here are some ways an IoT solution can help the company address each objectives<br>

Increase customer loyalty:
Implement IoT sensors in products to collect real-time usage data. Analyze this data to understand customer behavior and preferences. Use insights to enhance product features, address pain points, and tailor services to customer needs, ultimately increasing satisfaction and loyalty.<br>

Improve service maintenance and predictive maintenance:
Equip devices with sensors to monitor their health and performance in real-time. Analyze the data to predict when maintenance is needed, allowing for proactive service rather than reactive. This can reduce downtime and improve overall equipment efficiency.<br>

Manage spare parts inventory more efficiently:
Implement RFID tags or other tracking devices on spare parts. Use IoT platforms to monitor inventory levels in real-time. This helps in optimizing stock levels, reducing excess inventory, and ensuring that the right parts are available when needed.<br>

Improve product design and technician training:
Utilize IoT sensors to collect data on how products are used in the field. Analyze this data to identify areas for product improvement and innovation.<br>

Improve uptime and field service efficiency:
Leverage IoT data for predictive analytics to foresee potential issues before they occur. This allows for preventive maintenance, minimizing downtime and optimizing field service efficiency.<br>

Allocate scarce service technicians more efficiently:
Utilize IoT data to dynamically schedule service appointments based on real-time equipment conditions and technician availability. Optimize routes and allocate resources more effectively.<br>

Communicate more effectively with suppliers:
Integrate IoT devices into the supply chain to track the movement and condition of goods in real-time. This ensures better communication with suppliers, enabling timely reordering and reducing delays in the supply chain.<br>

### IoT Infrastructure
<strong>Selecting an IoT Infrastructure</strong><br><b>

Regulatory Compliance:
Comply with any regulations related to agriculture and data privacy.<br>

<b>B) Constraints within Greene Organix Greenhouse Operation:<br></b>

-Power Limitations:
Greenhouses may have limited access to power, requiring energy-efficient devices and possibly alternative power sources such as solar panels.<br>

-Connectivity Issues:
Rural locations might have limited internet connectivity. The IoT solution should account for intermittent or low-bandwidth connectivity.<br>

-Data Privacy and Compliance:
Compliance with agricultural regulations and data privacy laws, especially if the greenhouse operation involves sensitive data about crops and farming practices.<br>

-Cost Constraints:
Budget limitations may impact the selection of IoT devices and platforms. Cost-effective solutions should be considered without compromising functionality.<br>

-Skilled Workforce:
Availability of skilled personnel to maintain and troubleshoot the IoT infrastructure. Training programs may be necessary.<br>

-Environmental Conditions:
Extreme conditions within the greenhouse may impact the lifespan and performance of IoT devices. Robust, weather-resistant equipment is essential.<br>

-Scalability:
The IoT infrastructure should be designed to accommodate the potential growth of the greenhouse operation.
Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation and operation of the IoT solution in Greene Organix Greenhouses.
