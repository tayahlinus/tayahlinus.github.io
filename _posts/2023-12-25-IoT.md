# Internet of Things

## IoT Seminar
I was unable to attend the IoT seminar, but I was able to ask one of my friends who took the course about the events that took place. I also used some of the ideas and pictures from that day to use here. In the seminar, there was an experiment about a simple traffic light made with jumper cables/wires, LEDs (red, yellow, green), a breadboard, USB cable resistors, and an Arduino Uno.
